The Poolboy operator...

This is an example page for exercises to be done for the workshop. You would remove this page, replace it with your own and then adjust the `workshop.yaml` and `modules.yaml` file to list your pages instead.

In this example the pages which make up the core of the workshop content are placed in a sub directory. This is only done as a suggestion. You can place all pages at the same directory level if you wish.

Included below are some tests and examples of page formatting using AsciiDoc.
